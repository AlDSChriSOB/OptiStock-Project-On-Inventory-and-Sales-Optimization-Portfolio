OptiStock Project: Inventory and Sales Optimization
Project Overview
The OptiStock Project is focused on optimizing inventory management and sales processes for a retail business. By leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, this project aims to predict demand, manage stock levels, and maximize sales opportunities. It helps businesses maintain optimal inventory levels, reduce stockouts, prevent overstocking, and ultimately increase profitability.

Key Objectives
Demand Forecasting:

Predict future product demand using historical sales data.
Utilize machine learning models to forecast demand for different product categories.
Inventory Optimization:

Determine the optimal stock levels to maintain based on forecasted demand, lead times, and sales velocity.
Implement dynamic replenishment strategies.
Sales Performance Analysis:

Analyze sales patterns, customer preferences, and product performance.
Identify key drivers behind sales fluctuations and make recommendations for sales strategies.
Key Skills and Techniques
The following techniques were applied during the analysis and optimization process:

Data Preprocessing:

Data Cleaning: Handled missing data, outliers, and duplicates.
Feature Engineering: Created relevant features from raw data, such as sales trends, seasonality factors, and product characteristics.
Data Transformation: Applied log transformations and scaling to handle skewed data.
Statistical Analysis:

Correlation Analysis: Assessed relationships between product features, sales, and inventory to understand underlying patterns.
Time Series Analysis: Applied techniques like moving averages, and seasonal decomposition to analyze demand and sales trends over time.
Machine Learning Techniques:

Demand Forecasting: Utilized models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for predicting future product demand.
Sales Prediction: Built predictive models for understanding which products will likely see higher sales, incorporating customer behavior and market trends.
Optimization Models: Implemented linear programming and other optimization algorithms to determine optimal stock levels for each product.
Evaluation and Model Tuning:

Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-Squared.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Applied GridSearchCV to fine-tune model parameters for better predictive accuracy.
Data Visualization:

Sales Performance Dashboards: Created visualizations using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to display trends, forecasts, and stock levels.
Time Series Plots: Visualized demand forecasts and sales trends to inform decision-making.
